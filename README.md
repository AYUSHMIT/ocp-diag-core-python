# ocp-diag-python

The OCP Test & Validation Initiative is a collaboration between datacenter hyperscalers having the goal of standardizing aspects of the hardware validation/diagnosis space, along with providing necessary tooling to enable both diagnostic developers and executors to leverage these interfaces.

Specifically, the ocp-diag-python project makes it easy for developers to use the OCP Test & Validation specification artifacts by presenting a pure-python api, used to output spec compliant JSON messages.
